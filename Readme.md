# This was my mini project based on using generative ai for detecting calories in food realtime.
##The AI Calorie Counter is designed to identify food items from images and provide accurate nutritional information. Below are the results and discussions of various scenarios where the system was tested, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability.

### 1. Detecting Single Food Item:
The system successfully identified a single apple from the image and provided detailed nutritional information

#### Outcome:
##### The AI Calorie Counter correctly identified the food item and matched the nutritional data with high accuracy.

                                                              

### 2. Detecting Multiple Food Items:
In this test, the system analyzed an image containing 3 apples  
#### Outcome:
##### The system accurately identified each apple and gave total calorie 


 
                                                             




### 3. Identifying Packaged Foods:
The system was tested with an image of a packaged food item, such as a coke zero. It utilized OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read the nutritional label and cross-checked it with the database.
#### Outcome:
##### The AI Calorie Counter accurately read the nutritional label and provided correct nutritional information.


                                                         










### 4. Handling Complex Dishes:
The system analyzed an image of a complex dish like a local indian dish with various ingredients

#### Outcome:
##### The AI Calorie Counter was able to identify dish name and total calories
                                                            








### 5. Real-time Analysis and Reporting:
The system was tested for its real-time analysis capabilities where users took a picture of his homemade food and uploaded it to the system, images in real-time, and the system provided immediate nutritional information.
Outcome:
#### The AI Calorie Counter provided real-time nutritional data with a response time of less than 3 seconds per image.
